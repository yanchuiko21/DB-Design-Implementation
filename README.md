# DB-Design-Implementation
Design and implementation of a database for an e-commerce website.

# Requirement Analysis

This section will outline the specific requirements for the database, including the types of data that need to be stored, the relationships between different data elements, and the access patterns that will be used.

# Design

This section will translate the requirements into a well-structured database schema. The schema will define the tables, columns, and relationships between the tables. It will also consider issues such as data normalization, data integrity, and performance optimization.

# Implementation

This section will create the database using the chosen database management system - MySQL. The implementation will include creating the database tables, populating them with data, and creating the necessary indexes to improve performance.

# Testing

This section will thoroughly test the database to ensure that it meets the requirements and is functioning correctly. This will involve testing the database schema, the data, and the application code that interacts with the database.
